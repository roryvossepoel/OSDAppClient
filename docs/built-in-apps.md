# Built-in applications

Built-in applications use vendor-native acquisition and installation instead of the repository package contract.

Currently supported:

```text
Microsoft365Apps
Teams
AdobeAcrobatUnified
GoogleChromeEnterprise
MozillaFirefoxEnterprise
```

## Machine-readable metadata

The current built-in application catalog is also published as:

[`metadata/builtins.json`](../metadata/builtins.json)

This JSON is intended for external tooling and includes the application Id, display name, vendor, supported architectures/channels, Add/Sync commands, acquisition model, cache path and synchronization phase.

CI validates the file against the module's exported built-in Add commands so a new built-in cannot be added without updating the metadata.

## Vendor-only source policy

Built-in applications are always sourced directly from their software vendor.

OSDApps does not contain, embed, mirror, redistribute, or publish built-in application installers or payloads. The module only contains acquisition and installation logic plus vendor-owned URLs or supported endpoints.

```text
Vendor
→ download at cache/deployment time
→ optional OSDCloud USB cache
→ local staging
→ installation
```

The OSDCloud USB cache is only a local deployment cache of vendor content. It is never a distribution source maintained by OSDApps.

This rule is absolute for built-ins: if a product cannot be obtained directly and maintainably from the vendor, it is not eligible for built-in support.

Repository applications are different. Repository content is controlled by the repository owner, and OSDApps does not prescribe where that organization obtains or hosts those packages.

## Configuration and synchronization

Each built-in has its own cmdlet and parameter set.

### Microsoft 365 Apps

```powershell
Sync-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps `
    -Channel Current `
    -Architecture x64 `
    -ProductId O365ProPlusRetail `
    -Language nl-nl,en-us `
    -SharedComputerLicensing $true
```

A sync is also a configuration action. Changing parameters rewrites the desired Office configuration and refreshes the cache.

Supported channels:

```text
Current
MonthlyEnterprise
SemiAnnual
CurrentPreview
SemiAnnualPreview
BetaChannel
```

Supported product IDs:

```text
O365ProPlusRetail
O365BusinessRetail
```

Supported architectures:

```text
x64 (default)
x86
```

ODT configuration XML still uses OfficeClientEdition=64/32.

The Office cache contains the Office Deployment Tool, `configuration.xml`, and `Office\Data`.

The built-in Office configuration uses a shared XML generator for `Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps` and `Sync-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps`. The common parameters are `Architecture` (x86/x64, x64 by default), `Channel`, `ProductId`, `Language`, `UpdatesEnabled`, `AcceptEula`, `SharedComputerLicensing`, `DeviceBasedLicensing`, and `ExcludeApp`. Optional `IncludeVisio` and `IncludeProject` switches include `VisioProRetail` and `ProjectProRetail` as separate Office Deployment Tool products. Each product gets the requested languages; exclusions apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps. The respective licenses must be assigned separately.

```powershell
# Default: Enterprise x64, Current channel, en-us, updates on
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps

# Typical Dutch Office with monthly enterprise updates and Visio/Project
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps -Channel MonthlyEnterprise -Language nl-nl -IncludeVisio -IncludeProject

# Shared workstation with licensed individual users
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps -SharedComputerLicensing $true

# Specialized device-based licensing, requiring an eligible device license
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps -DeviceBasedLicensing $true

# Disable Office updates (Windows update management must be handled elsewhere)
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps -UpdatesEnabled $false
```

For advanced or unusual configurations, export XML from Microsoft's Office Customization Tool and pass `-ConfigurationXml <path>`. The supplied XML is checked only for file existence and well-formed XML syntax (without DTD or external entity resolution), then preserved without modification. Office Deployment Tool validates its own products, channels, languages and other configuration semantics. Do not simultaneously supply conflicting generated configuration switches; the custom XML takes precedence.

### Microsoft Teams

```powershell
Sync-OSDAppTeams -Architecture x64
```

Supported architectures:

```text
x64 (default)
x86
arm64
```

The Teams cache contains:
- `teamsbootstrapper.exe`
- `teams.msix`
- `CacheInfo.json`

Teams freshness is checked using HTTP metadata. ETag is preferred; Last-Modified plus Content-Length is the fallback.

### Adobe Acrobat Unified

Adobe Acrobat Unified supports Adobe's official x64 and x86 unified Acrobat/Reader packages. x64 is the default.

```powershell
# x64 is the default
Sync-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified
Add-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified

# optional x86
Sync-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified -Architecture x86
Add-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified -Architecture x86
```

The cache contains:

```text
BuiltIn\AdobeAcrobatUnified\
├── x64\
│   ├── Package.zip
│   └── CacheInfo.json
└── x86\
    ├── Package.zip
    └── CacheInfo.json
```

The ZIP remains compressed while cached and staged. During installation the standalone runner extracts it to the local work directory, locates `Setup.exe`, and runs the Adobe-supported silent installation command:

```text
Setup.exe /sAll /msi ADDLOCAL=ALL
```

The Adobe installation timeout defaults to 15 minutes. While Setup.exe is running, the runner logs a heartbeat every 60 seconds. Override the timeout when needed:

```powershell
Add-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified -InstallTimeoutMinutes 20
```

x64 is used when `-Architecture` is omitted. x86 and x64 caches are kept separately so a single OSDCloud USB can hold both variants.

During WinPE, a populated USB cache is staged to the **same architecture-specific relative path** on the Windows disk: `Windows\Temp\OSDApps\BuiltIn\AdobeAcrobatUnified\x64\Package.zip` (or `x86`). `DeviceManifest.json` and the SetupComplete runner reference that exact path. If the cache is empty, the runtime downloads it later; if a cached archive is copied, staging verifies that the expected file exists and its size matches the USB source.

### Google Chrome Enterprise

Google Chrome Enterprise uses Google's official Enterprise MSI directly from Google's download infrastructure. x64 is the default and x86 is optional. Google documents Windows Enterprise deployment with both 64-bit and 32-bit MSI packages.

```powershell
# x64 default
Sync-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise
Add-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise

# optional x86
Sync-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise -Architecture x86
Add-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise -Architecture x86
```

Cache layout:

```text
BuiltIn\GoogleChromeEnterprise\
├── x64\
│   ├── Package.msi
│   └── CacheInfo.json
└── x86\
    ├── Package.msi
    └── CacheInfo.json
```

Installation uses Windows Installer:

```text
msiexec.exe /i Package.msi /qn /norestart
```

### Mozilla Firefox Enterprise

Mozilla Firefox Enterprise uses Mozilla's official MSI redirect endpoint. Both Rapid Release and ESR are supported, with x64 as the default architecture and `en-US` as the default language.

```powershell
# Rapid Release, x64, en-US
Sync-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise
Add-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise

# ESR
Sync-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise -Channel ESR
Add-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise -Channel ESR

# x86 or another Mozilla locale
Sync-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise -Architecture x86 -Language nl
Add-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise -Architecture x86 -Language nl
```

Cache layout keeps channel, architecture, and language isolated:

```text
BuiltIn\MozillaFirefoxEnterprise\
└── <Rapid|ESR>\
    └── <x64|x86>\
        └── <language>\
            ├── Package.msi
            └── CacheInfo.json
```

Installation uses:

```text
msiexec.exe /i Package.msi /qn /norestart
```

Mozilla notes that its MSI is a signed wrapper around the full Firefox installer, but it supports the standard MSI deployment options needed here.

## How update freshness is determined

Built-in applications use evergreen vendor sources, but OSDApps avoids downloading large installers again when the cached artifact is still current.

The freshness mechanism is product-specific:

| Application | Update check | Download behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft 365 Apps | Office Deployment Tool `/download` synchronizes the configured channel/product/languages | ODT decides which Office files are missing or changed. OSDApps resolves the cached build from `Office\Data\<version>` before and after synchronization. |
| Microsoft Teams | HTTP metadata for the official MSIX: `ETag` preferred, otherwise `Last-Modified + Content-Length` | MSIX is downloaded only when the metadata changed or no valid cached MSIX exists. The Teams bootstrapper is refreshed on every online sync. |
| Adobe Acrobat Unified | HTTP metadata for the official Adobe ZIP: `ETag` preferred, otherwise `Last-Modified + Content-Length` | `Package.zip` is downloaded only when the remote metadata changed or no cached ZIP exists. |
| Google Chrome Enterprise | HTTP metadata for the official Enterprise MSI: `ETag` preferred, otherwise `Last-Modified + Content-Length` | `Package.msi` is downloaded only when the remote metadata changed or no cached MSI exists. |
| Mozilla Firefox Enterprise | HTTP metadata for the Mozilla latest MSI endpoint: `ETag` preferred, otherwise `Last-Modified + Content-Length` | `Package.msi` is downloaded only when the remote metadata changed or no cached MSI exists. Channel, architecture, and language are cached separately. |

### HTTP metadata comparison

For Teams, Adobe Acrobat Unified, Google Chrome Enterprise, and Mozilla Firefox Enterprise, OSDApps first asks the vendor endpoint for remote file metadata.

The comparison order is:

```text
1. ETag
   └─ if both remote and cached ETag are present, compare ETag

2. Last-Modified + Content-Length
   └─ used when ETag is not available

3. No usable match
   └─ download the current vendor artifact
```

The previous values are stored in the built-in `CacheInfo.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "RemoteETag": "...",
  "RemoteLastModified": "...",
  "RemoteContentLength": 169652224,
  "RemoteFinalUri": "...",
  "SyncedAt": "..."
}
```

This means OSDApps does **not** need to open an MSI or extract a ZIP just to decide whether Chrome, Firefox, or Adobe should be downloaded again. The update decision is based on cheap vendor metadata checks.

A metadata match means:

```text
cached artifact exists
+
vendor metadata still matches
=
reuse cached artifact
```

A metadata change means:

```text
vendor metadata changed
or cache metadata/artifact is missing
=
download current vendor artifact
→ replace cache
→ update CacheInfo.json
```

### Microsoft 365 Apps is different

Microsoft 365 Apps does not use the generic HTTP metadata comparison for the Office payload.

OSDApps runs the Office Deployment Tool in download mode with the staged configuration:

```text
setup.exe /download configuration.xml
```

ODT is responsible for synchronizing the requested channel, architecture, product, languages, and exclusions. Existing Office content is reused by ODT where possible.

OSDApps reads the concrete cached build from:

```text
Office\Data\<version>
```

and records that value in `CacheInfo.json`. Comparing the version before and after the ODT run allows the log to report whether the cached Office build actually changed.

### Choosing built-in Office or repository Office

The Microsoft 365 Apps built-in deliberately favors freshness over the shortest possible deployment time.

During full Windows, OSDApps lets the Office Deployment Tool synchronize the configured Office source before installation:

```text
full Windows
→ ODT /download
→ reuse existing Office cache where possible
→ update changed Office content when required
→ stage current Office content locally
→ install
```

This has an important advantage: ODT is the authoritative Microsoft mechanism for acquiring Office content, so the same step that checks freshness can immediately update the cache when a newer build is available.

The trade-off is that even when the cached build is unchanged, the ODT synchronization step still takes some time.

If deployment speed is more important than checking Microsoft for a current Office build during SetupComplete, Microsoft 365 Apps can instead be packaged as a normal repository application.

In that model:

```text
self-maintained repository
→ organization decides which Office build is current
→ repository sync/update happens in WinPE
→ Package.zip is staged to the OS
→ full Windows installs the staged package
→ no built-in Office ODT freshness check
```

This is an intentional OSDApps design choice:

| Approach | Freshness owner | Sync moment | Full-Windows overhead | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft / ODT | Full Windows | ODT synchronization before install | Evergreen Office with minimal package maintenance |
| Repository-packaged Microsoft 365 Apps | Repository owner | WinPE | No built-in ODT refresh step | Maximum deployment-time predictability and organization-controlled versioning |

Neither approach is inherently better. Built-ins optimize for vendor-native evergreen maintenance; repository applications optimize for organization-owned packaging, version control, and deterministic deployment behavior.

This same principle applies more broadly in OSDApps: a supported built-in is a convenience path, not a requirement. Any application can still be delivered through the self-maintained repository when that better matches the deployment strategy.

### Microsoft Teams bootstrapper

The Teams MSIX uses the normal metadata comparison and is skipped when the cached MSIX is still current.

The small `teamsbootstrapper.exe`, however, is intentionally downloaded again during an online synchronization so the provisioning bootstrapper itself remains current. This does not require re-downloading the much larger Teams MSIX when its metadata has not changed.

### Sync timing

Built-in freshness checks happen in **full Windows**, during PreInstall / SetupComplete.

```text
WinPE
→ stage built-in intent and available fallback cache

Full Windows
→ check vendor freshness
→ refresh cache only where required
→ stage current payload locally
→ Runner installs
```

Repository applications follow a different lifecycle: their versions and hashes are controlled by the self-maintained repository and repository synchronization occurs in **WinPE**, not during the full-Windows PreInstall phase.

## Deployment flow

The same commands are used with or without USB cache:

```powershell
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps
Add-OSDAppTeams
Add-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified
Add-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise
Add-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise
```

In WinPE, the built-in Add cmdlets stage deployment intent and any already-available cached payload into Windows Temp. A USB cache is not required.

In full Windows, PreInstall resolves the source automatically:
- if an `OSDCloud` USB cache is present, it is used and updated;
- if no `OSDCloud` USB cache is present, content is acquired directly to the local Windows runtime;
- current content is staged locally before the runner starts;
- the runner installs from local content.

## No-USB mode

No alternate parameter or command is required.

When no `OSDCloud` volume is connected, PreInstall downloads the current built-in content directly into the local Windows runtime under `%SystemRoot%\Temp\OSDApps`. The runner then installs from that local source.

When an `OSDCloud` volume is connected, it is detected automatically. Existing cache content is used when available and the cache is refreshed/updated during SetupComplete.

A completely blank `OSDCloud` volume is supported. OSDApps creates the cache structure and populates it during the full-Windows pre-install phase.

## Fallback behavior

A refresh or acquisition failure does not block deployment when a complete staged fallback is available. If no usable local or USB-cached payload exists and online acquisition also fails, PreInstall returns a fatal error and the Runner is not started.

The absence of an `OSDCloud` USB is not an error: when online, PreInstall acquires built-in content directly to the local Windows runtime.

Office refresh has a 20-minute timeout by default.

## USB cache behavior

USB is not required for built-in deployment.

If an `OSDCloud` USB volume is detected, cache functionality is enabled automatically. Keep that media connected until OOBE is displayed so SetupComplete can use and update the cache.

If no `OSDCloud` volume is present, built-ins are acquired directly to the local Windows runtime.


## Verbose staging diagnostics

Use:

```powershell
Add-OSDAppMicrosoft365Apps -Verbose
Add-OSDAppTeams -Verbose
Add-OSDAppAdobeAcrobatUnified -Verbose
Add-OSDAppGoogleChromeEnterprise -Verbose
Add-OSDAppMozillaFirefoxEnterprise -Verbose
```

Verbose output shows:
- offline Windows target detection;
- OSDCloud cache-volume detection;
- whether an existing built-in cache is complete;
- local staging decisions;
- SetupComplete integration;
- the selected acquisition path.

When OSDCloud cache media is detected, the Add cmdlet also emits a warning to keep the USB connected until OOBE is displayed.

The same decisions are written to the CMTrace-compatible logs.


## Validated deployment behavior

OSDApps has been validated with both blank-cache and warm-cache deployments using the same Add commands and installation queue.

Validated behavior includes:

- blank `OSDCloud` media being populated automatically during full-Windows PreInstall;
- existing built-in cache content being detected and staged as fallback;
- unchanged Teams, Chrome, and Adobe payloads being reused after lightweight freshness checks;
- Microsoft 365 Apps being synchronized by ODT and reporting whether the cached Office build changed;
- successful installation from local staged content;
- cold-cache versus warm-cache timing with stable Runner installation times.

See [Validation matrix](testing.md) and [Performance](performance.md) for the current end-to-end evidence.

## Requesting a new built-in application

Built-ins are maintained as product-specific code in OSDApps, so they are deliberately selective. A request should only be considered when the application is a good fit for a generic, repeatable deployment path.

### Required characteristics

A built-in candidate should:

- be broadly used in enterprise or managed Windows environments;
- have a direct, deterministic vendor download source;
- be acquired from that vendor at runtime/cache time rather than being bundled, mirrored, or redistributed by OSDApps;
- use a stable URL, documented API/endpoint, or similarly maintainable vendor-supported acquisition method;
- support unattended installation with predictable exit codes;
- work without customer-specific credentials, tenant-specific portals, or interactive download flows;
- be maintainable without scraping HTML, browser automation, traffic sniffing, or reverse-engineering temporary download links.

### Download-source rule

OSDApps must be able to acquire the installer directly from the vendor in a predictable way.

A vendor using a CDN is not automatically a problem. The requirement is that the vendor exposes a stable, supported download URL or endpoint. A built-in will not be added when the installer must come from a third-party mirror, community package source, OSDApps itself, or when acquisition depends on techniques such as:

```text
scraping a download page
sniffing browser/network traffic
following undocumented JavaScript-generated links
capturing short-lived signed URLs
reusing session cookies or access tokens
bypassing CDN / anti-bot protections
reverse-engineering a protected download workflow
```

If the vendor changes a stable URL behind the scenes while keeping the published endpoint stable, that is fine. The module should not need to discover or reconstruct hidden CDN URLs itself.

### When to use the repository instead

The repository model is the default for applications that are:

- customer-specific;
- line-of-business or internally developed;
- uncommon or narrowly used;
- hosted internally;
- accessible only after authentication;
- distributed through portals with non-deterministic download links;
- unsuitable for a generic vendor-native maintenance flow.

Those applications belong in `catalog.json` / `Package.zip`, where the organization controls acquisition and packaging.

### What to include in a request

A useful built-in request should include:

- product name and vendor;
- vendor documentation URL;
- direct installer URL(s) or documented download endpoint;
- supported architectures;
- unattended installation command;
- evidence that the application is broadly used;
- expected update/freshness mechanism if known.

A request meeting these criteria can still be declined if the vendor's acquisition or installation model is too fragile to maintain safely.
